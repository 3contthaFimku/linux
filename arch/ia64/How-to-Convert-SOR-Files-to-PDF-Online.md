# How to Convert SOR Files to PDF Online
 
SOR files are a type of optical test data file that contain information about fiber optic cables, such as length, attenuation, and events. They are generated by devices called optical time-domain reflectometers (OTDRs), which measure the characteristics of optical fibers. SOR files can be viewed and analyzed by specialized software, but they are not widely compatible with other applications or devices.
